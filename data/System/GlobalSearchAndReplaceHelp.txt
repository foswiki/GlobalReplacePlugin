---++ Rows Explained

The three rows with *blue* headers are used to find topics that contains text to be replaced. The three rows with *black* headers are used to find and replace text within the topics found in the previous three *blue* rows

|  *Row* | *Meaning* | *Default* |
|  Topic Search String: | Fully supported regular expression search | empty string |
|  Search Scope: | text or topic | text |
|  Web: | A single web name, e.g., Foswiki | current web (now %WEB%) |
|  Replace Search String: | Fully supported regular expression search. Up to four substrings in the found string may be "captured" by enclosing them in parentheses | empty string |
|  Replace String: | Text that will replace the found text. Captured substrings from the Replace Search String are accessed with $1, $2, $3, and $4. Use $topic for the topic name. | empty string |
|  Case Sensitive Replace Search: | yes or no | yes |

---++ Using Global Search And Replace

Example Global Search and Replace: <br />
%IMAGE{"GSR.gif" topic="System.GlobalSearchAndReplaceHelp" width="796" height="474" align="none" type="simple"}%

Note that there are two different search strings to define:
   1. The search string to select a set of topics (the =Topic Search String=)
   1. The search string to find the expression to replace within a topic (the =Replace Search String=) <p> </p>

These strings may be the same, especially when searching within the text, but both must be specified.

__Note:__ Steps 1 and 2 may be combined.

---+++ Step 1: Select the Topics

Start by specifying the search criteria that will select the set of topics that contain
the expression that is to be replaced. Using the top three rows first, you can try
out different expressions. The =Topic Search String= fully supports regular expressions.

Select a =Search Scope= of =text= to search within a topic (the default), or select =topic= to search within the topic name only.

Enter the web to search (default: the current web). Only a single web is supported.

Click =Search=.

Foswiki will display a list of topics meeting the search criteria. If the list is
correct, proceed to Step 2; otherwise, go =Back= in your browser, correct the search
criteria, and click =Search= again. (Or click =Start Over= to clear all fields.)

Note: You do not need to escape special characters, i.e. the double quote ("), or
worry about Foswiki macros rendering in =Replace Search String= and =Replace String=.
However, =Topic Search String= must be written as you would for the =search= parameter
of a %SE%NOP%ARCH%. Thus, to have =%W%NOP%EB%= search correctly in =Topic Search
String=, you must use =%WEB[%]= to escape the Foswiki rendering. There is a known
bug that if you escape a double quote with =\"= upon hitting the =Search= button
the escape character, '\', will disappear but the search will have functioned properly.

---+++ Step 2: Find the Text to Replace and Specify the Replacement

The next step is to define a =Replace Search String=: the string to search for and
replace within each topic selected by Step 1. The =Replace Search String= also fully
supports regular expressions. Like regular expressions, you can capture up to four
substrings using parentheses. Then use $1, $2, $3, and $4 in the =Replace String=
to insert the captured substrings. See above example.

Set the =Replace String= to the new string which is to replace the found strings.
The =Replace String= can be blank (which will delete the strings found in the selected
topics). A known issue with the replace string is documented below.

Again click =Search=. Foswiki will display a page of all "hits" on each topic selected
in Step 1. Each hit has a checkbox and shows the =Replace Search String= highlighted
in red and the =Replace String= in orange. If possible, the results will display
the 40 characters on each side of the hit for context.

Nothing will be saved until completing Steps 3 and 4 below.

Once satisfied, proceed to Step 3. If the results are not as required, go =Back=
in your browser, correct any of the fields in the form, and click =Search= again
to display a new set of results.

---+++ Step 3: Select the Hits to be Replaced

Click the checkboxes for the hits you want to replace. Use the =Set All= and =Clear All= buttons below the hits if convenient.

---+++ Step 4: Make the Replacements

Once the checkboxes are as required, click =Replace All Check Marked Hits= to commit your changes.

Only members of the %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup will be allowed to commit changes.

---++ Known Issues

Currently, the =Replace String= cannot handle more than one set of double quotes.
For example, =%<nop>META:FIELD{name="TopicClassification" title="TopicClassification"
value="ChangeRequest"}%= will be truncated to =%<nop>META:FIELD{name="TopicClassification"=
if you try to commit the changes.
